#Art Swap App User Stories

##As a user, I want to know what this app is all about, so I know whether I want to use it or not.

##As a user, I want to be able to create and update a profile, so that I can use the app.

##As a user, I want to be able to see which resources are up for swapping.

As a user, I want to trade for skills, because it helps me solve problems that I need another artist’s help to solve, and I am able to share my expertise in a practical way with a community of peers.

As a user, I want to trade for materials, because materials are expensive and I often have materials that might be of more value to another artist than they are to me.

As a user, I want to trade for artwork, because I appreciate the work of other artists, and trading work is another way to barter for skills of materials.


As a user, I want to list materials that I am not longer using, so that I can trade with another artist, who might have something of more value to me.

As a user, I want to list artwork that I willing to trade, so that I can exchange it for skilled/general labor, materials or other artwork that I want.

As a user, I want to make trades with artists located near me, so that I don’t have to travel too far for trades.
